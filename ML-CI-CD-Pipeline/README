CI/CD Pipeline for Machine Learning Model
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for automating the deployment of a machine learning (ML) model. It showcases the integration of DevOps practices with ML workflows, utilizing cloud-native services and modern DevOps tools.
Features
Automated ML Model Deployment: Streamlined process from development to production.
Containerization: ML model packaged in Docker for consistency across environments.
CI/CD Integration: Automated build, test, and deployment using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
Kubernetes Deployment: Scalable and manageable deployment on cloud-based Kubernetes services.
Performance Monitoring: Real-time tracking of model performance and resource utilization.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
ML Framework: Scikit-learn
Containerization: Docker
CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Jenkins
Orchestration: Kubernetes (AWS EKS or GCP GKE)
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
Logging: ELK Stack or Datadog

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the ML model: python model/train.py
Build Docker image: docker build -t ml-model:latest .
Push the image to a container registry
Apply Kubernetes configurations: kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
Set up monitoring tools (Prometheus and Grafana)
CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline automates the following steps:
Code push triggers the pipeline
Run unit tests
Build and push Docker image
Deploy to Kubernetes
Run integration tests
Monitor performance
Monitoring and Logging
Access Grafana dashboards for real-time performance metrics
Use ELK Stack or Datadog for log analysis and troubleshooting
