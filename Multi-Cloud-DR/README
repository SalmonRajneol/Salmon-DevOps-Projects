Multi-Cloud Disaster Recovery Solution
Overview
This project implements a robust disaster recovery (DR) solution across multiple cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for a sample web application. By leveraging the strengths of different cloud providers, we create a resilient infrastructure capable of withstanding various failure scenarios.
Features
Multi-Cloud Deployment: Sample application infrastructure replicated across AWS, Azure, and GCP.
Automated Failover: Seamless transition between cloud platforms during outages.
Cross-Cloud Data Replication: Ensures data consistency across all platforms.
Infrastructure as Code: Utilizes Terraform for consistent provisioning across clouds.
Comprehensive Monitoring: Implements Prometheus and Grafana for real-time health tracking.
Technologies Used
Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
Containerization: Docker
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
Scripting: Python, Bash
Database: AWS RDS, Azure SQL, GCP Cloud SQL
Storage: AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage

Setup Instructions
Clone this repository
Navigate to the terraform directory and initialize each cloud provider's configuration
Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform
Set up the sample application in the primary cloud (AWS)
Configure cross-cloud data replication using the provided scripts
Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
Test the failover mechanism using the failover script
Testing
Regular testing is crucial to ensure the reliability of the DR solution. Follow these steps:
Simulate a failure in the primary cloud
Verify automatic failover to a secondary cloud
Check data consistency across all platforms
Monitor the process using Grafana dashboards
